    "What are some of the ethical concerns that machine learning applications could raise?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate \n",
    "at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as \n",
    "input to predict new output values.\n",

    "1. Real-time chatbot agents:\n",
    "One of the earliest forms of automation are chatbots, which have bridged the communication gap between people and technology\n",
    "by allowing people to essentially converse with machines that can then take actions based on the requests or requirements \n",
    "voiced by humans. Early generations of chatbots followed scripted rules that told the bots what actions to take based on\n",
    "keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, machine learning and natural language processing(NLP), another member of the AI technology family, enable chatbots\n",
    "to be more interactive and more productive. These newer chatbots better respond to user's needs and converse increasingly \n",
    "more like real humans. \"Digital assistants such as Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa, are based on machine learning \n",
    "algorithms, and this technology may find its ways in new customer service and engagement platforms that replace traditional\n",
    "chatbots,\" said Lian Jye Su, a principal analyst at ABI Research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chatbots are the among the most widely used machine learning applications in business. A few examples of company chatbots \n",
    "that have won kudos include the following:\n",
    "Watson Assistant, touted by its IBM for providing \"fast, straightforward answers,\" is programmed to know when it needs to \n",
    "ask for clarity and when to triage the request to a human being.\n",

    "decision support is another area where machine learning can help businesses turn the plethora of data they have into \n",

    "In the healthcare industry, clinical decision support tools that incorporate machine learning guide clinicians on diagnoses\n",

    "Supervised Learning deals with two types of problem- classification problems and regression problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification problems-\n",

    "6. Is machine learning capable of solving all problems? Give a detailed explanation of your answer.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "DATA Limitation is the most obvious limitation in ML. If you feed a model poorly, then it will only give you poor results.\n",
    "This can manifest itself in two ways: lack of data, and lack of good data.\n",
    "Lack of Data - \n",
    "Many machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data before they begin to give useful results. A good example of \n",
    "this is a neural network. Neural networks are data-eating machines that require copious amounts of training data. The \n",
    "larger the architecture, the more data is needed to produce viable results. Reusing data is a bad idea, and data \n",
    "augmentation is useful to some extent, but having more data is always the preferred solution.If you can get the data, then \n",
    "use it.\n",
    "Lack of Good Data - \n",
    "Despite the appearance, this is not the same as the above comment. Let’s imagine you think you can cheat by generating ten\n",
    "thousand fake data points to put in your neural network. What happens when you put it in?\n",
    "It will train itself, and then when you come to test it on an unseen data set, it will not perform well. You had the data \n",
    "but the quality of the data was not up to scratch.\n",
    "In the same way that having a lack of good features can cause your algorithm to perform poorly, having a lack of good \n",
    "ground truth data can also limit the capabilities of your model. No company is going to implement a machine learning model\n",
    "that performs worse than human-level error.\n",
    "Similarly, applying a model that was trained on a set of data in one situation may not necessarily apply as well to a \n",
    "second situation. The best example of this is the breast cancer prediction.\n",
    "Mammography databases have a lot of images in them, but they suffer from one problem that has caused significant issues in \n",
    "recent years — almost all of the x-rays are from white women. This may not sound like a big deal, but actually, black women\n",

    "differences in detection and access to health care. Thus, training an algorithm primarily on white women adversely impacts\n",
