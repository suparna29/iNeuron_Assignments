    "1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "copy() will copy a single file, shutil.copytree() will copy an entire folder and every folder and file contained in it. Calling shutil.copytree(source, destination) will copy the folder at the path source, along with all of its files and subfolders, to the folder at the path destination "

(This is similar as opening a text file in write mode by passing 'w' to the open() function.) This code will create a new ZIP file named new.zip that has the compressed contents in it."
