    "Class:- class definitions start with the class keyword, which is followed by the name of the class and a colon. Any code \n",
    "that is indented below the class definition is considered part of the class’s body. We use the class keyword to define an \n",
    "empty class. From class, we construct instances. An instance is a specific object created from a particular class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object:- An object (instance) is an instantiation of a class. When we instantiate a class, we get an object. \n",
    "We can instantiate an object, similar to calling a class like a function.\n",
